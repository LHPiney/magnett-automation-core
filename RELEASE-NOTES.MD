v.1.0.1 (2025-09-14)
- WorkFlows.Runtimes.NodeBase: BUGFIX â€” failure path now emits `OnNodeFailedEvent` instead of `OnNodeCompletedEvent`.
- Migration: If you were listening for `OnNodeCompletedEvent` when a node failed, update subscribers to handle `OnNodeFailedEvent` instead. Update any tests asserting the emitted event on failure.

- Events: IEventBus.StopAsync now accepts optional CancellationToken for graceful shutdown (non-breaking).

- WorkFlows: FlowRunnerBase.ExecuteNodeAsync now forwards CancellationToken to sync nodes (INode) via new INode.Execute(Context, CancellationToken) overload; existing Execute(Context) remains and delegates (non-breaking API addition).
