# Patterns and Best Practices

This section covers common patterns and best practices when using Magnett Automation Core.

## Design Patterns

### Saga Pattern
The Saga pattern is used for managing distributed transactions. It breaks a complex transaction into a series of local transactions, each with a corresponding compensation transaction.

[Learn more about Saga Pattern](saga-pattern.md)

### Event Sourcing
Event sourcing stores the state of an application as a sequence of events. This pattern provides a complete audit trail and enables time-travel debugging.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
CQRS separates read and write operations, allowing for different models and optimizations for each.

### State Machine Pattern
State machines provide a structured way to handle complex state transitions and business logic.

## Best Practices

### Event Design
- Use immutable event classes
- Include all necessary context in events
- Use meaningful event names
- Version your events for backward compatibility

### State Machine Design
- Keep states focused and cohesive
- Use clear action names
- Handle all possible transitions
- Include error states

### Workflow Design
- Break complex processes into smaller, focused nodes
- Use meaningful exit codes
- Handle cancellation properly
- Include proper error handling

### Context Management
- Use type-safe context fields
- Minimize context size
- Use appropriate data types
- Handle null values properly

## Anti-Patterns

### Common Mistakes
- Creating overly complex workflows
- Not handling cancellation tokens
- Using string-based context keys
- Ignoring event ordering
- Not implementing proper error handling

### Performance Considerations
- Avoid blocking operations in event handlers
- Use appropriate async patterns
- Monitor memory usage in long-running workflows
- Implement proper cleanup and disposal

## Migration Patterns

### From Legacy Systems
- Identify bounded contexts
- Extract business processes
- Implement event-driven communication
- Gradually migrate functionality

### Versioning Strategies
- Use semantic versioning
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Provide migration guides
- Use feature flags when appropriate
